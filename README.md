Here are scripts for running a timelapse photobooth station based on some Unix machine; probably a Raspberry Pi.

Have Fun!

Also, if you're super-skilled with crontab you can go ahead and do that, but if you don't really know what I'm talking about but are running a Raspberry Pi with the default Raspbian OS, then I recommend you do the following:

sudo apt-get install gnome-schedule

This give you a nice tool for managing cronjobs without having to do all the manual crontab editing.
